# üå•Ô∏è iOS Weather App 

Is a deliberately simple project, chosen as an ideal starting point for those learning iOS development. 
The decision to build a weather app was twofold ‚Äì it serves as a beginner-friendly project and allows the developer 
to consolidate knowledge about making API calls and implementing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.



## Key Features

- **Current Weather Information:** Users can easily retrieve the current weather conditions for a specific location.
- **Minimalist Interface:** The app boasts a clean and aesthetically pleasing design.
- **API Integration:** Demonstrates the process of calling external APIs to fetch real-time weather data, showcasing a crucial aspect of modern app development.
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture:** The project adheres to the MVC design pattern, promoting a well-organized and maintainable code structure.

## Build Process

1. Created a mockup version of the app, designing the user interface and establishing a brand identity with a cohesive color palette.
2. Initiated a new Xcode project, opting to eliminate the default storyboard for a more programmatic approach to UI development.
3. Deleted the storyboard to allow for coding the interface manually, gaining a deeper understanding of UIKit and programmatic UI development.
4. Utilized a previous project as a reference to add constraints programmatically, ensuring a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes.
5. Developed the model responsible for retrieving weather data from an external API, laying the foundation for real-time updates.
6. Set up the network session and incorporated API keys for secure communication with the "weatherstack" API, a Real-Time & Historical World Weather Data provider.
7. Implemented code to fetch and parse weather data from the API, enabling the app to display accurate and up-to-date information.
8. Completed the coding of the user interface, ensuring a seamless integration with the data retrieved from the API.
